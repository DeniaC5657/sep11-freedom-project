During the engineering and creating process, there was alway time to overlook your work and designs. Creating and improving something new does take trill and error until you are pleased with the final results.

The ability and skills that I grew up with were creativity. I have always been taught to always think ‘outside the box’ and try seeing something in a new view, even seeing the same object in someone else's shoes. I wanted this design to show the negative and positive of future technology,

I am proud of myself to see my prototype and draft design reach the point that I wanted to impress the most, maybe one day it will help improve future technology.
