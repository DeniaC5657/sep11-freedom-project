# Entry 1

I am very passionate about Video Game, seeing many gamers from all over the world set world records in hardcore game, building up speed levels, have amazing time, even building up stunning accury with Video Game. The Kotuka, “Game controllers are theoretically designed to allow people to easily input the largest number of button combinations with a minimum of physical movement” Personally, I see many gamers set amazing world records using many different controllers from around the world, some are more modern, while others are more ‘old school’. This shows how the many gamers from all over the world prove that controllers are the main tools of setting world records. Due to this many controllers are ‘made’ for many gamers. Some gamers used many different controllers for different games while others stick to only one model to every game. This is very useful to future video game controllers model, to help gamers to find the perfect controllers that will create records. 

According to Kotuka, there are many solutions to a comuable controller, including lightweight, less rough, easy on the eye. It didn’t take much searching to find 13 Things, and I know there are already method you can do with the controllers

I am currently in thinking of the engineering design process: defining and researching the problem. Up next, I will be brainstorming possible solutions. This will require thinking outside the box about how to tackle this issue in a way that hasn’t been done before. So far in class, we’ve learned about the basics of hardware, and I’m realizing that the possibilities are endless with the help of an Arduino.

Regarding skills, I think I’m growing in learning “Controller designer” specifically evaluating sources on the problem I’ve chosen, seeing what really goes into creating the ‘perfect’ controller. There are plenty of methods of building a fully custom controller that will fit your hand personally while there are ways to buy the ‘perfect’ controller.
