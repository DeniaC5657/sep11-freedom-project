Entry 3

Tools: A-Frame


Draft Idea Project:
    Idea: A city view and the camera move inside an apartment room.

When you first enter the website, you are greeted with the title of the topic, and will move around the player while stated facts and soon the camera moment will stop and the (people) could move around the room (any direction) and see the facts in the cloud bubble on top the gamer head.

Idea: A player looking at the tv screen, holding (playing) a video game controller, and while the gamer is playing his game. A cloud bubble be above the gamer head and be showing facts about (‘Video Game Addiction’) and will change after a few seconds  (ex. A health fact about VG addiction every 5-7 seconds)
