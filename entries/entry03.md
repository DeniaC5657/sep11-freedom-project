Tools: A-Frame (https://aframe.io/)

A frame is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunication. A frame typically includes frame synchronization features consisting of a sequence of bits or symbols that indicate to the receiver the beginning and end of the payload data within the stream of symbols or bits it receives.

A-Frame is a great tool that is used to created 3D object that can be used to showcase a new bulding plan, street project, gaming beginning, etc. A-Frame also use basic code to creat 3D model of real-life items. At the beginning, A-Frame look very 'high-tech' and like learning a new language. I didn't know how to even start, but after watching (Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6_C4UqTfs) and reading some starter code, coding seem very simple but number play a huge part of placing/creating a new model. After playing and creating small draft model. A-Frame can create some amazing models that could share real-life models of famous buildings, etc.

Draft Idea Project:
    Idea: A city view and the camera move inside an apartment room.

When you first enter the website, you are greeted with the title of the topic, and will move around the player while stated facts and soon the camera moment will stop and the (people) could move around the room (any direction) and see the facts in the cloud bubble on top the gamer head.

Idea: A player looking at the tv screen, holding (playing) a video game controller, and while the gamer is playing his game. A cloud bubble be above the gamer head and be showing facts about (‘Video Game Addiction’) and will change after a few seconds  (ex. A health fact about VG addiction every 5-7 seconds)

Some Example Code:
<html>
 <head>
   <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.3/aframe.min.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
   <a-scene>
     <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
     <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
     <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
     <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
     <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
   </a-scene>
 </body>
</html>

A-Frame, is a amazing tool that could create amazing high-tech models, and I can't wait to continued working with A-Frame.
