# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Denia Casimiro

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for Intro to Computer Science is all about working with technology. The purpose of this blog is to showacase my work.

## Content
For my project, I am addressing the problem of why video game controllers are so uncomfortable. I’m noticing that many controllers are uncomfortable in a person's hand, so I decided to create a controller that is comfortable in the hand. Not too heavy, rough, and easy on the eye. This blog will walk through my process of creating this innovation.

## Implications
According to the Kotaku, “The modern PS4 controller, Xbox One controller, and Nintendo Switch Pro controller all have more or less the same functionality as their predecessors. Of course, some people still think it’s time for new ideas.” This shows how many gamers from all over the world complain how some controllers could hurt their hand movement and game-play. I believe the controller is the main tool that many gamers set records with. For example, if there’s a soccer game and the ball isn’t fill with air, that will affect the game-play of all players and will affect the game. Soccer players are trained to control the ball, handle the hard kicks, and build up their speed, but if the ball isn’t ready for ‘game time’ that could leave a poor game and could even hurt the players. That the same problem many gamers are facing with. Therefore, finding a controller that is inexpensive and still fit nicely in a player hand will set world game records from all over the world.
